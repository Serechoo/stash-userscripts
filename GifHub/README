#GifHub Mass Updater

Be sure to create a 'plugins' subdirectory of the root drive ie. 'C:\plugins' and place the GifHub.py file there for now.

Place the GifHub.yml in your Stash native 'plugins' directory so that Stash reads it correctly.

Make sure to click the 'Reload Plugins' button under 'Settings > Plugins > Reload Plugins'

This was a WiP, I am not currently developing it, but will look to refine it in the future.
