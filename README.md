# Batch Create All - Stash
This is a code to allow batch create jobs for your stash. 

The idea behind it is this: Once you have the userscripts for 'Search All' installed and click it, you can then look to click the 'Create All' button that is installed via this javascript. 

**Known bug currently**: Please refresh the page when you get to the Tagger view in the 'Scenes' page. This should load the 'Create All' button.

**Please note:** This script has only been tested in Chrome and in conjunction with the Neon Dark theme. Since it does target specific elements within the theme, it may have to be modified/generalized to work with other themes.

**Another note:** This version of the script does not have logic in place (yet) to detect already added performers and studios that may exist in your Stash. As a result, Stash will throw plenty of errors during the automation, but otherwise, the script should complete successfully, albeit a bit messy.
